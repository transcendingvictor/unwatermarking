# Unwatermarking
Project intended to train GenAI image models on removing watermarks from images.

Give executable permisions to the setup.sh script (run "chmod +x setup.sh" in your terminal) and then run it ("./setup.sh" in your terminal) to create a virtual environment and install the requirements.
